// Open javascripot-2/index.html in the browser. You should see "An Ode to Code" and a small box below it.

//////////////////STEP 1////////////////////
//Create a variable called lovesCode and set it true or false (as a boolean) depending on if you love code or not. It's okay if you don't, yet

const lovesCode = false;
// LOVE is a very serious word.  I currently am still getting to know code. Code seems great, but its too soon to tell. It's only been like a week and a half..... it hasn't been love at first sight, lets just say that.

//////////////////STEP 2////////////////////
//Create a variable called age that is your age as a number

const age =  37;
// don't you know its rude to ask ladies how old they are?! I am only as old as I feel!!!  and RIPE AGE?!?!?  at 37 I am pretty ripe.

//////////////////STEP 3////////////////////
//Create a variable called name that is your name as a string

const name = "Mimi";

//////////////////STEP 4////////////////////
//Create a variable called phrase that is initially set as an empty string

const phrase = '';

//////////////////STEP 5////////////////////
//Create an if statement that checkes to see if the lovesCode variable is equal to true, if it is, set the phrase variable created above to 'I love code', it it's not true set the phrase variable to 'I do not love to code'

if (lovesCode === true) {
    const phrase = "I love to code";
} else {
    const phrase = "I do not love to code";
}

// Refresh the index.html page in your browser. You should now see a poem that uses the variables from above.
